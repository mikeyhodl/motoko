# Bumping the Rust Nightly Toolchain

This skill guides you through bumping the `rustc-nightly` version used to build
the Motoko RTS.

## Files to Change

| File | What to update |
|------|----------------|
| `nix/pkgs.nix` | Nightly date string in `rust-bin.nightly."YYYY-MM-DD"` |
| `nix/rts.nix` | `rustStdDepsHash` (fixed-output derivation hash) |
| `flake.lock` | Run `nix flake update rust-overlay` to get latest overlay |
| `rts/motoko-rts/Cargo.toml` | Bump any exact-pinned crate versions if vendoring fails |
| `rts/motoko-rts/Cargo.lock` | Run `cargo update` in `rts/motoko-rts/` |
| `rts/motoko-rts-tests/Cargo.lock` | Run `cargo update` in `rts/motoko-rts-tests/` |

## Step-by-Step

### 1. Switch branch and rebase
```sh
git checkout $USER/bump-nightly-rustc
git rebase origin/master
```
Note: the previous bump usually lands on `master` via **squash-merge**, which
leaves this branch's old bump commit orphaned (present locally, not an ancestor
of `origin/master`, and often carrying a nightly date `master` already has). In
that case don't rebase onto the stale commit — hard-reset the branch to master
and redo the bump fresh:
```sh
git fetch origin master
git checkout -B $USER/bump-nightly-rustc origin/master
```
(Check first with `git merge-base --is-ancestor $USER/bump-nightly-rustc
origin/master` — if it says the branch has unmerged commits *and* they're a real
WIP, keep them; if they're just the last, already-merged bump, reset.)

### 2. Update rust-overlay
```sh
cd ~/motoko && nix flake update rust-overlay
```

### 3. Set nightly date in `nix/pkgs.nix`
```nix
rust-nightly = self.rust-bin.nightly."YYYY-MM-DD".default.override {
```
Start with a recent date (e.g. a few weeks before today). If tests hang or
fail, bisect backwards by 2-4 weeks at a time.

### 4. Get new `rustStdDepsHash`
Set it to a dummy value first:
```nix
rustStdDepsHash = "sha256-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA=";
```
Then run:
```sh
nix build .#rts 2>&1 | grep "got:"
```
Paste the `got:` hash back into `nix/rts.nix`. Note: this hash is often
**identical across several months** of nightly dates.

### 5. Update Cargo lockfiles
```sh
cd rts/motoko-rts       && cargo update
cd rts/motoko-rts-tests && cargo update
```
If `nix build .#rts` fails with "failed to select version for `foo = =X.Y.Z`",
bump that exact pin in `rts/motoko-rts/Cargo.toml` and re-run `cargo update foo`.

### 6. Build and test
```sh
nix build .#rts
```
Watch for compiler errors — common ones encountered and their fixes:

#### `.json target specs require -Zjson-target-spec`
Add `-Zjson-target-spec` to `NIGHTLY_CARGO_OPTIONS` in `rts/Makefile`.

#### `target-pointer-width: invalid type: string "32", expected u16`
Change `"target-pointer-width": "32"` → `"target-pointer-width": 32` (integer)
in `rts/motoko-rts/wasm32-none-shared.json` and `wasm64-none-shared.json`.

#### `panic_immediate_abort is now a real panic strategy`
Remove `panic_immediate_abort` from `-Zbuild-std-features` and add
`-Zunstable-options -Cpanic=immediate-abort` to `RTS_RELEASE_COMPILE_FLAGS`.
Use `NIGHTLY_RELEASE_CARGO_OPTIONS` in `rts/Makefile`.

#### `failed to select version for rustc-literal-escaper = "^0.0.7"`
The vendored std deps are stale — re-run the `rustStdDepsHash` probe (step 4).

### 7. `.#rts` vs `.#rts-checked` on macOS

`flake.nix` distinguishes two derivations:

- **`.#rts`** — the build alone. On darwin this skips the host-side `cargo
  test` suite, so `nix build .#rts` is fast and is what you iterate on locally.
- **`.#rts-checked`** — always runs the `cargo test` suite. On darwin this
  exercises the wasm64 debug tests under `wasmtime` in the nix sandbox, which
  can be **~10× slower** than Linux (likely due to XProtect/MRT intercepting
  wasm memory ops). Triggered in CI by the `nightly-macos-test` workflow's
  `rts-checked` job; not normally needed locally.

**Local bump loop:** `nix build .#rts` until green. Then push and **manually
dispatch** `nightly-macos-test` to exercise the slow `rts-checked` path — it
triggers **only** on `schedule` + `workflow_dispatch`, so a branch push does NOT
run it automatically (see step 9).

**If `nightly-macos-test` jobs fail or time out**, re-trigger — each run
caches more derivations, so subsequent runs make progress:
```sh
gh workflow run nightly-macos-test --repo caffeinelabs/motoko --ref <branch>
```
Two known failure modes that are *not* code regressions:

1. **OOM on `systems-go-tests`** — fails in ~4 min with `patch: **** out of
   memory` while building `ocaml4.14.2-merlin-*` from scratch (before any
   tests run). Runner memory pressure. Re-trigger.
2. **Slow `gc-tests` / `common-tests`** — same XProtect/wasm64 malaise; they
   eventually finish. Be patient, don't cancel.

### 8. Commit
```
chore: bump rustc-nightly to YYYY-MM-DD

- nightly date: old → new
- rust-overlay: updated to YYYY-MM-DD
- rustStdDepsHash: updated for new nightly
- rts/Makefile: <list any Makefile fixes>
- wasm{32,64}-none-shared.json: <if changed>
- motoko-rts: bump foo =X.Y.Z → =X.Y+1.Z
- cargo update: motoko-rts, motoko-rts-tests
```

### 9. Push and watch CI
```sh
git push --force-with-lease origin $USER/bump-nightly-rustc
# nightly-macos-test does NOT run on push — dispatch it explicitly:
gh workflow run nightly-macos-test.yml --ref $USER/bump-nightly-rustc
gh run watch <run-id> --repo caffeinelabs/motoko
```
Gotcha — **first push after a reset (step 1)**: if the old remote branch was
deleted when the previous bump merged, `--force-with-lease` fails with
`! [rejected] ... (stale info)` because your local `origin/$USER/bump-nightly-rustc`
tracking ref is stale (points at a branch that no longer exists remotely). Fix:
```sh
git remote prune origin
git push -u origin $USER/bump-nightly-rustc   # plain push re-creates the branch
```

## Makefile Structure (as of 2026-04-01)

```makefile
RTS_COMPILE_FLAGS=-C target-feature=+bulk-memory
RTS_RELEASE_COMPILE_FLAGS=$(RTS_COMPILE_FLAGS) -Zunstable-options -Cpanic=immediate-abort
NIGHTLY_CARGO_OPTIONS=-Zjson-target-spec -Zbuild-std=core,alloc
NIGHTLY_RELEASE_CARGO_OPTIONS=$(NIGHTLY_CARGO_OPTIONS) --release -Zbuild-std-features="optimize_for_size"
```

## Notes
- `rustStdDepsHash` has been stable (`sha256-ZMCepUZNyqXZcR3EduSV38zFbI89WneU1iTXj3L38RA=`)
  from at least 2026-02-15 through 2026-03-31.
- `libm` is exact-pinned (`=0.2.x`) in `motoko-rts/Cargo.toml` — bump it if
  `cargo update` in `motoko-rts-tests` moves it and the vendor fails.
- The nix sandbox uses `pkgs.wasmtime` from the pinned nixpkgs rev — check
  `wasmtime` version doesn't regress performance between nixpkgs bumps.
