# Motoko documentation

Motoko is a modern, high-level programming language designed specifically for building smart contracts (canisters) on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP). Combining the familiarity of other modern languages with powerful features like actor-based concurrency, orthogonal persistence, and seamless WebAssembly integration, Motoko empowers developers to launch scalable and secure applications.

#### 💡 Easy to learn
Whether you're coming from JavaScript, Rust, Swift, or Java, Motoko's familiar syntax and clear structure will feel familiar and easy to pick up.

#### 🔐 Secure by design
Motoko's strong type system and automated memory management are designed to reduce bugs and increase auditability.

#### 📦 Data persistence, built-in
No external databases required. With orthogonal persistence, data automatically persists across application upgrades.
