# core/Debug
Utility functions for debugging.

Import from the core package to use this module.
```motoko name=import
import Debug "mo:core/Debug";
```

## Function `print`
``` motoko no-repl
func print(text : Text)
```

Prints `text` to output stream.

NOTE: When running on an ICP network, all output is written to the [canister log](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/smart-contracts/maintain/logs) with the exclusion of any output
produced during the execution of non-replicated queries and composite queries.
In other environments, like the interpreter and stand-alone wasm engines, the output is written to standard out.

```motoko include=import
Debug.print "Hello New World!";
Debug.print(debug_show(4)) // Often used with `debug_show` to convert values to Text
```

## Function `todo`
``` motoko no-repl
func todo() : None
```

Mark incomplete code with the `todo()` function.

Each have calls are well-typed in all typing contexts, which
trap in all execution contexts.

```motoko include=import
func doSomethingComplex() {
  Debug.todo()
};
```
