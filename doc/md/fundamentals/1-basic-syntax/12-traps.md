# Assertions

An assertion checks a condition at runtime and traps if it fails.

```motoko
let n = 10;
assert n % 2 == 1; // Traps
```

```motoko
let n = 10;
assert n % 2 == 0; // Succeeds
```

Assertions help catch logic errors early, but should not be used for regular [error handling](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/motoko/fundamentals/error-handling).
