Classical orthogonal persistence was the legacy implementation of Motoko's orthogonal persistence. It has been **removed**: `moc` no longer accepts `--legacy-persistence` (nor the classical-only flags `--copying-gc`, `--compacting-gc`, `--generational-gc`, `--rts-stack-pages`, `--skip-gc-deprecation-warning`), and 32-bit (`wasm32`) RTS builds no longer exist. All canisters are now compiled with [enhanced orthogonal persistence](./enhanced.md).

Upon upgrade, the classical orthogonal persistence mechanism used to serialize all stable data to the stable memory and then deserialize it back to the main memory. This had several downsides:

* At maximum, 2 GiB of heap data could be persisted across upgrades. This is because of an implementation restriction. Note that in practice, the supported amount of stable data could be way lower.
* Shared immutable heap objects could be duplicated, leading to potential state explosion on upgrades.
* Deeply nested structures could lead to a call stack overflow.
* The serialization and deserialization was expensive and could hit ICP's instruction limits.
* There was no built-in stable compatibility check in the runtime system. If users ignored the `dfx` upgrade warning, data could be lost or an upgrade could fail.

:::danger
The above-mentioned issues could lead to a stuck canister that can no longer be upgraded.
Therefore, it was absolutely necessary to thoroughly test how much data an upgrade of your application can handle and then conservatively limit the data held by that canister.
Moreover, it was ideal to have a backup plan to rescue data even if upgrades fail, e.g. by controller-privileged data query calls. Another option was to [snapshot](https://docs.internetcomputer.org/guides/canister-management/snapshots) the canister before attempting the upgrade.

These issues are solved by [enhanced orthogonal persistence](./enhanced.md).


:::note
Existing classical canisters are **not** orphaned: the runtime keeps reading all earlier classical stable-memory formats, and a classical canister migrates to enhanced persistence on its next upgrade. Recompile with `--enhanced-orthogonal-persistence` (and without `--enhanced-migration`) and redeploy to enable this irreversible one-way migration — without the flag, a recompiled module sees the earlier classical format and traps with the message `Detected implicit upgrade from classical orthogonal persistence to enhanced orthogonal persistence`; with `--enhanced-migration` it traps with `Cannot upgrade from classical orthogonal persistence with --enhanced-migration`. Subsequent upgrades no longer need the flag.

Because `--legacy-persistence` is gone, `moc` can no longer *produce* classical canisters. Projects that still need a classical module must keep an older `moc` (e.g. 1.14.x).
