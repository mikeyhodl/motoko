# Data structures

## Mops packages for data structures

[Mops](https://mops.one/) is an onchain package manager for Motoko. Here are some Mops packages for data structure implementations:

- [`augmented-btrees`](https://mops.one/augmented-btrees): An implementation of BTree variants, most notable the B+Tree.

- [`buffer-deque`](https://mops.one/buffer-deque): A Buffer with Deque functionality of a Deque for efficient insertion and deletion at both ends.

- [`bitbuffer`](https://mops.one/bitbuffer): Bit level and byte level manipulation.

- [`circular-buffer`](https://mops.one/circular-buffer): Circular buffer implementation.

- [`enumeration`](https://mops.one/enumeration): Add-only key sets with numbering and two-way lookup.

- [`linked-list`](https://mops.one/linked-list): Doubly linked lists, featuring functions for node-level access.

- [`map`](https://mops.one/map): Stable hash maps.

- [`memory-buffer`](https://mops.one/memory-buffer): Persistent buffer implementations.

- [`memory-hashlist`](https://mops.one/memory-hashlist): Storing and accessing blobs into memory associated with blob-key.

- [`memory-hashtable`](https://mops.one/memory-hashtable): Storing, updating, deleting, and retrieving a single blob-value per key.

- [`merkle-patricia-trie`](https://mops.one/merkle-patricia-trie): A Merkle Patricia Trie implementation following the Ethereum specification

- [`splay`](https://mops.one/splay): A library for splay trees.

- [`stable-buffer`](https://mops.one/stable-buffer): Buffers implemented in stable regions.

- [`stable-enum`](https://mops.one/stable-enum): Enumerations implemented in stable regions.

- [`stableheapbtreemap`](https://mops.one/stableheapbtreemap): BTreeMaps that can persist across upgrades via a stable variable in heap memory.

- [`stable-rbtree`](https://mops.one/stable-rbtree): Stable RBtree.

- [`stable-trie`](https://mops.one/stable-trie): Stable trie.

- [`swb`](https://mops.one/swb): Sliding window buffers featuring random access functionalities.

- [`swbstable`](https://mops.one/swbstable): Stable sliding window buffer with random access.

- [`vector`](https://mops.one/vector): Memory-efficient resizable array. Can be used as a replacement for `Buffer`.
