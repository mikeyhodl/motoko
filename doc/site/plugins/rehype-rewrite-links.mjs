/**
 * Rehype plugin that rewrites relative .md links for Astro's directory-based output.
 *
 * Authors write GitHub-friendly relative links with .md extensions:
 *   [Quickstart](quickstart.md)
 *   [Concepts](../concepts/canisters.md#lifecycle)
 *
 * Astro outputs each page as a directory (project-structure.md → project-structure/index.html),
 * so the browser resolves relative links one level deeper than the author expects.
 * This plugin strips .md extensions and prepends an extra ../ to compensate.
 *
 * Exception: index.md files are output as <dir>/index.html (not <dir>/<dir>/index.html),
 * so the browser's base URL is already at the correct directory level; no extra ../
 * is needed for those pages.
 *
 * Result (regular pages):
 *   quickstart.md                              → ../quickstart/
 *   ../concepts/canisters.md#lifecycle         → ../../concepts/canisters/#lifecycle
 *   ./sibling.md                               → ../sibling/
 *
 * Result (index pages):
 *   backends/data-persistence.md               → backends/data-persistence/
 *   ../concepts/canisters.md                   → ../concepts/canisters/
 *
 * Only relative links are affected; external URLs, anchors, and absolute paths are untouched.
 *
 * Important: Astro caches rendered content in node_modules/.astro/data-store.json.
 * After changing this plugin, delete that file to force re-rendering.
 *
 * Note: This is a rehype (HTML-level) plugin, not a remark plugin. Starlight overrides
 * Astro's markdown.remarkPlugins, but rehypePlugins are correctly merged. See:
 * https://github.com/dfinity/icp-cli/issues/423
