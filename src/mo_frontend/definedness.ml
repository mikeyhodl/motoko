(*
This module implements a check that rules out use-before define.
It is a compositional algorithm that returns, for each subexpression,
 * Which variables are used eagerly and
 * which are delayed
these sets are disjoint and their union makes up the set of free variables, so
the structure of this module is very similar to that of freevars.ml.

We keep it still separate, because we are doing much more interesting things
here in for blocks (function decs).

(* Usage tracking. We distinguish between eager and delayed variable use.
   Eager variables become delayed
   - inside lambda
   Delayed variables may stay delayed
   - when storing variables in data structures (tuples, objects, arrays)
   Delayed variables become eager
   - when occurs in an application
   - when a block uses some of its own variables eagerly
