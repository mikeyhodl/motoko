(unknown location): Compatibility error [M0170], the new type of stable variable `state` is not compatible with the previous version.
 The previous type
  var {#v1 : [[var Cell]]; #v2 : {bits : [var Nat64]; size : Nat}}
 is not a subtype of
  var {#v1 : [[var Cell]]}
 because: Missing tag `#v2` in type 
  {#v1 : [[var Cell]]}
 of state.
 Write an explicit migration function, please see https://internetcomputer.org/docs/motoko/fundamentals/actors/compatibility#explicit-migration-using-a-migration-function.
