(unknown location): Compatibility error [M0170], the new type of stable variable `ln` is not compatible with the previous version.
 The previous type
  List<Int> = ?(Int, List<Int>)
 is not a subtype of
  List<Nat> = ?(Nat, List<Nat>)
 because: The type 
  Int
 is not compatible with type 
  Nat
 in List (used by ln).
