(unknown location): Compatibility error [M0170], the new type of stable variable `four` is not compatible with the previous version.

  var [var (Text, Nat)]
 because: More tuple arguments in four than expected.
 Write an explicit migration function, please see https://internetcomputer.org/docs/motoko/fundamentals/actors/compatibility#explicit-migration-using-a-migration-function.
